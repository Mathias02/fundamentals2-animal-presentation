          <h3>A friend rang a bell in my dream</h3>
          <p>Being part of the tech world was my long-date dream of becoming a programmer, however, I never knew where to go study it since being an IT technician was something I never loved. I found myself in the marketing world which sent my dream to bed. Four years ago, as I was sharing a business plan with a work colleague, this one rang a bell in my sleeping dream when he promised to provide a website for our business; straight away my dream woke up that I became so inquisitive to know the tools and techniques he used to build the websites with but, unfortunately, he gave me tutorials on android that I couldn't handle well on my own as I was a newbie and that situation once again sent my dream of becoming a programmer back to bed.</p>

          <h3>Amazon brought my dream back</h3>
          <p>I was applying for a job at Amazon and among the requirements for that marketing vacancy was this sentence "must be able to write in Html." Before I could apply for that job, I went to search for HTML to really know what it was, from there my dream woke up and never I applied for that job but rather got involved with the tech world. Eventually, I am living my long-date dream and my decision is to make coding my professional career since my plan is to do this for life.
            I was for a long time searching for the opportunity that I am offered by CYF and I am so happy to belong to such a tech program. This has strengthened me a lot that I feel so energized to excel in programming. I am, eventually, where I was supposed to be and doing what I was supposed to be doing a decade ago.</p>
